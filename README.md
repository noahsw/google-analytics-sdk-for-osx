google-analytics-sdk-for-osx
============================

This unofficial SDK allows you to track usage of your OS X applications. Google built an Analytics SDK for iOS and Android but hasn't yet built one for desktop apps. As far as I can tell, we are not violating **(Google's Terms of Service)[http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html]**.


Instructions
------------
1. Add your Google Analytics ID to the project pList
2. Build the framework
3. Add the framework as a reference to your app's project
